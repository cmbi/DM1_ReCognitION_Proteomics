This folder contains the results of the statistical modeling efforts that explored the associations between protein group expression and clinical variables. 
Each file contains a list of the protein groups and for the variable of interest the associated estimate, standard error, nominal significant p-value, the FDR corrected p-value (and the pearson correlation).

Corresponding statistical analysis: Bootstrap enhanced Elastic-Net regression.
